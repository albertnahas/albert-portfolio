## Approach & Philosophy

### Building Software
- **User-first**: Always start with the user problem
- **Keep it simple**: Avoid over-engineering
- **Developer experience matters**: Tools should feel great to use
- **Iterate quickly**: Ship fast, learn, improve
- **Build in public**: Share knowledge and learn from others

### Code Quality
- Clean, readable code over clever code
- Strong typing and compile-time safety
- Comprehensive tests where they matter
- Documentation that helps, not just exists
- Performance by default, not as an afterthought

### Learning & Growth
- Active in open source communities
- Constantly exploring new technologies
- Sharing knowledge through projects and writing
- Mentoring other engineers
- Focused on AI + frontend intersection
