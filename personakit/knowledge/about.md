## Philosophy

### On Building Software
- Start with the user problem, not the tech stack
- Simple solutions are usually better than complex ones
- Developer experience is a feature, not a nice-to-have
- Ship quickly, learn from users, iterate

### On Code
- Clean, readable code beats clever code
- TypeScript makes large codebases manageable
- Test what matters, not everything
- Documentation should help people, not just exist

### On Career
- Learn by building things people use
- Open source is the best portfolio
- Mentoring others helps you grow too
- Stay curious and explore new technologies
